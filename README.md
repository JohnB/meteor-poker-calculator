## What's in this boilerplate

The "insecure" and "autopublish" packages are removed by default. Several other packages are added, which are listed on the bottom. There's already a lot of predefined code in this boilerplate, to show you the possible functionality.

### Features

* Comprehensive folder structure
* TDD / BDD with [laika](http://arunoda.github.io/laika/)
* Multi page apps with [iron-router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router)
* A way to load fixtures (as of now no external packages used for that)
* meteor-boilerplate console tool, which helps on creating views, routes and so on (meteor-boilerplate.bat for windows users)
